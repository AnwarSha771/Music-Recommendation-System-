Music Recommendation System (Non-Python)
A GitHub Project

Overview
This project is a music recommendation system built without Python, designed to demonstrate modern recommendation algorithms and scalable architecture using alternative programming languages such as JavaScript (Node.js), Java, or C#. The system provides personalized music suggestions by leveraging collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches.

Features
Personalized Recommendations: Suggests music based on user preferences and listening history.

Multiple Algorithms: Supports collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models.

API Integration: Connects with external music metadata APIs (e.g., Spotify, Last.fm, Deezer).

Scalable Architecture: Built with microservices, containerization, and caching for performance.

Modern Frontend: User-friendly interface for browsing, rating, and discovering music.

Extensible Design: Easily add new algorithms, data sources, or frontend features.

Technology Stack
Component	Options/Examples	Purpose
Backend	Node.js, Java, C# (.NET)	Core logic, APIs, recommendation engine
Frontend	React, Vue, Angular	User interface
Database	PostgreSQL, MongoDB	User data, music metadata, interactions
Caching	Redis	Fast access to recommendations
Containerization	Docker	Deployment and scaling
External APIs	Spotify, Last.fm, Deezer	Music metadata and audio features
System Architecture
Frontend Layer: Web/mobile app for user interaction.

API Gateway: Handles authentication, routing, and rate limiting.

Backend Services: User management, music catalog, recommendation engine, analytics.

Data Storage: Databases for users, music, and interactions.

Caching: Stores pre-computed recommendations for fast retrieval.

Recommendation Algorithms
Collaborative Filtering: Recommends music based on similar usersâ€™ preferences.

Content-Based Filtering: Suggests tracks with similar audio features or metadata.

Hybrid Approaches: Combines multiple algorithms for improved accuracy.

Getting Started
Clone the Repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-recommendation-system.git
